High Level - My project originally started out as a program that would draft the best available player for you in a fantasy baseball draft, but I quickly realized that I would need to make a fantasy baseball draft to implement it. As a result, my project is a customizable fantasy baseball draft, as well as the program draft automatically for team 2 and drafts the best available player for you. 

I used the module BeautifulSoup which is a web scraping tool that makes it very easy to scrape text from HTML. I am pretty sure that I included the library in the submission, but if not:

1. you can download from here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BeautifulSoup/3.2.0

2. Go to terminal and cd to your Downloads or wherever it downloaded to
3. Enter the command tar -xf BeautifulSoup-3.2.0.tar
4. cd BeautifulSoup-3.2.0
5. You can then move it to wherever you need to run the code
